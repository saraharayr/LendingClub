# LendingClub

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, to compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Supervised Machine Learning Challenge
In this assignment, you I built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not.

# The Results

It was determined that Random Forest Classifier performs with accuracy with both unscaled and unscaled data. On the other hand, Logistic Regression scored poorly on preprocessed data, but after scaling improved significantly. Both models are efficient and not one is better than the other, rather they have different strengths and weaknesses.
